          their health gets sapped out. The target may struggle out of the bite.

          Pokemon: Creation of Zygarde

        <p className="about-experience">
          I was the founder and owner of a game called Pokemon: Creation of
          Zygarde, which aimed to bring animated 3D models of Pokemon to the
          platform. At the time, the best Pokemon rendering technology on Roblox
          was with animated sprites. I was the solo scripter of the entire
          project, supported by 100,000+ people, which was never released, due
          to copyright issues. I was 14 years old at the time. To achieve
          animated meshes in Roblox, which didn't support mesh deformation at
          the time, I used a frame by frame mesh rendering method, where we'd
          split the animation into frames, and manipulate them in Roblox using
          CFrames.
